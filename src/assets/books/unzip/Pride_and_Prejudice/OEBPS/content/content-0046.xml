<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA249.w.2.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.280.2.1.box.154.516.999.178.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA249.w.2.1.0"></a>The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA249.w.2.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.280.2.2.box.154.700.1000.827.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA249.w.2.2.0"></a>Elizabeth&#39;s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!</p>

She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA250.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.281.1.0.box.138.186.1000.78.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA250"></a><a id="GBS.PA250.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA250.w.1.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA250.w.2.0.0"></a>

They followed her into the dining-parlor. It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA250.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.281.1.2.box.140.1206.1000.355.q.50"><a id="GBS.PA250.w.2.2.0"></a>&quot;And of this place,&quot; thought she, &quot;I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.&#8212;But no,&quot;&#8212;recollecting herself,&#8212;&quot;that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.&quot;</p>

At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle;<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA251.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.282.1.0.box.154.204.997.225.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA251"></a><a id="GBS.PA251.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA251.w.1.0.0"></a>
and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, &quot;But we expect him tomorrow, with a large party of friends.&quot; How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed&#160;a day!</span></p>

She approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master&#39;s steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. &quot;He is now gone into the army,&quot; she added; &quot;but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.&quot;</p>

The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people&#39;s happiness were in his guardianship!&#8212;how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!&#8212;how much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favorable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.</p>

Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener&#39;s expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease: when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.</p>

vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived&#8212;that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behavior, so strikingly altered,&#8212;what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!&#8212;but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.</span></p>

Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind&#8212;in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA258.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.289.1.0.box.139.203.1004.225.q.60">

Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA259.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.290.1.0.box.142.196.1002.1103.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA259"></a><a id="GBS.PA259.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA259.w.1.0.0"></a>
the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth&#39;s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words &quot;delightful,&quot; and &quot;charming,&quot; when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her color changed, and she said no more.</span></p>

and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was <span style="font-style:italic;">surprised </span>by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and, so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.

Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-and-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, &quot;Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed?

Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth&#39;s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband&#39;s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected&#8212;&quot;for your housekeeper,&quot; she added, &quot;informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.&quot; He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. &quot;They will join me early tomorrow,&quot; he continued, &quot;and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,&#8212;Mr. Bingley and his sisters.&quot;</span></p>

Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.</p>

At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly&#8212;and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the <i>t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te </i>was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.</p>

He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavorable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and <span style="font-style:italic;">that </span>in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.&quot;</p>

so faulty, nor Wickham&#39;s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.</span></p>
