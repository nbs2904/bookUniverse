They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy&#39;s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister&#39;s sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,&#8212;and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.</p>

<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA194.w.2.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.225.2.2.box.142.1590.997.222.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA194.w.2.2.0"></a>While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA195.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.226.1.0.box.131.193.1001.501.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA195"></a><a id="GBS.PA195.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA195.w.1.0.0"></a>
But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her titter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began&#8212;</span></p>

She stared, colored, doubted, and was silent. This he <i>  </i>considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of  all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides   those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not <i> </i>more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of <span class="gstxt_sup"></span> pride. His sense of her inferiority&#8212;of its being a degradation&#8213;of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely <span class="gstxt_sup"></span>to&#160;<a id="GBS.PA195.w.1.3.0"></a>recommend his suit. In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be <span class="gstxt_sup"></span><span class="gstxt_sup"></span><span class="gstxt_sup"></span>insensible to the compliment of such a man&#39;s affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive<a id="GBS.PA195.w.2.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA195.w.3.0.0"></a>; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger.

which, in spite of all his endeavors, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favorable answer. He <span style="font-style:italic;">spoke </span>of apprehension&#160;and <span class="gstxt_sup"></span>anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the color rose into her cheeks, and she said&#8212;</span></p>

But I cannot&#8212;I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.

His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.
