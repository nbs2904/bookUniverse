Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.

But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.

my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? <span class="gstxt_sup"></span>All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In  short, I will&#160;do my best.&quot;</span></p>

Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte&#39;s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA152.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.183.1.0.box.129.199.1000.539.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA152"></a><a id="GBS.PA152.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA152.w.1.0.0"></a>
would like Lady Catherine,&#160;and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighborhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine&#39;s behavior was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins&#39;s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.</span></p>

I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA153.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.184.1.0.box.141.210.997.77.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA153"></a><a id="GBS.PA153.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA153.w.1.0.0"></a>

She endeavored to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley&#39;s inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.</p>

But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behavior was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in sin<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA154.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.185.1.0.box.133.206.1002.1337.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA154"></a><a id="GBS.PA154.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA154.w.1.0.0"></a>gling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though <span style="font-style:italic;">we </span>know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behavior to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavor to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy&#8212;your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.&#8212;Yours, etc.&quot;</span></p>

His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of someone else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that <span style="font-style:italic;">she </span>would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte&#39;s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.</p>

But my feelings are not only cordial towards <span style="font-style:italic;">him; </span>they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA156.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.187.1.0.box.146.200.999.455.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA156"></a><a id="GBS.PA156.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA156.w.1.0.0"></a>
all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.&quot;</span></p>
