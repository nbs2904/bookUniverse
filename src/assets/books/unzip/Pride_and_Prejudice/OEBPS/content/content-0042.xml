These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a [salad] and cucumber.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA225.w.2.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.256.2.1.box.128.804.998.179.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA225.w.2.1.0"></a>After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, &quot;Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?&quot;</p>

I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA225.w.2.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.256.2.3.box.130.1315.998.317.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA225.w.2.3.0"></a>And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, With perfect unconcern, &quot;Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-colored satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the &#8212;&#8212;shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.&quot;</p>

It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!&quot;</span></p>

You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is such an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it? There is no danger of Wickham&#39;s marrying Mary King. There&#39;s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.&quot;</p>

Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can&#39;t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but <span style="font-style: italic;">I </span>do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster&#39;s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are <span style="font-style:italic;">such </span>friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman&#39;s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady,&#8212;only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA228.w.2.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.259.2.0.box.124.200.1034.365.q.50"><a id="GBS.PA228"></a><a id="GBS.PA228.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA228.w.1.0.0"></a>
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And <span style="font-style:italic;">that </span>made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.&quot;</span></p>

way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.

It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to <span style="font-style:italic;">her </span>of the regiment&#39;s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.
