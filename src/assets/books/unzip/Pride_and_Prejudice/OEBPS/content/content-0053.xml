He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honor or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its pr<a id="GBS.PA315.w.3.0.0"></a>oper place.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA315.w.2.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.346.2.1.box.123.840.998.223.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA315.w.4.0.0"></a>He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA315.w.2.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.346.2.2.box.122.1071.999.548.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA315.w.4.1.0"></a>When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia&#39;s birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband&#39;s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA315.w.2.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.346.2.3.box.123.1626.999.178.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA315.w.4.2.0"></a>Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA316.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.347.1.0.box.146.190.1002.733.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA316"></a><a id="GBS.PA316.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA316.w.1.0.0"></a>
regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother&#39;s hands, Lydia&#39;s expenses had been very little within that sum.</span></p>

When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.</p>

It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm-house. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA317.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.348.1.0.box.124.204.998.215.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA317"></a><a id="GBS.PA317.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA317.w.1.0.0"></a>
good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery was considered certain.</span></p>

No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighborhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.</p>

But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, &quot;Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into <span style="font-style:italic;">one </span>house in this neighborhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the imprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.&quot;</p>

his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter&#39;s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.</span></p>

There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister&#39;s frailty would have mortified her so much&#8212;not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia&#39;s marriage been concluded on the most honorable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.</p>

His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was a union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.</p>

Bennet&#39;s acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.

And I think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece&#39;s. It is Mr. Wickham&#39;s intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General &#8213;&#8213;&#39;s  regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.&#8212;Yours, etc.</p>

But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia&#39;s being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favorites.</p>

But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister&#39;s feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighborhood before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.</p>
