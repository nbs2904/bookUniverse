March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte&#39;s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA157.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.188.1.0.box.128.200.1000.76.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA157"></a><a id="GBS.PA157.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA157.w.1.0.0"></a>
was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.</span></p>

<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA157.w.1.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.188.1.1.box.129.292.1000.178.q.60">The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA157.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.188.1.2.box.130.477.1006.641.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA157.w.1.2.0"></a>The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her&#8212;their opinion of everybody&#8212;would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard, <i> </i>and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA157.w.1.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.188.1.3.box.130.1124.1000.455.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA157.w.1.3.0"></a>Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humored girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William&#39;s too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA157.w.1.4.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.188.1.4.box.130.1586.999.225.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA157.w.1.4.0"></a>It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner&#39;s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA158.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.189.1.0.box.164.192.1000.410.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA158"></a><a id="GBS.PA158.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA158.w.1.0.0"></a>
Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin&#39;s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.</span></p>

Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than&#39; astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley&#39;s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.</p>

Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.&quot;</p>
