His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of <span style="font-style:italic;">that </span>they would have been glad to be certain.

She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up&#8212;though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham&#39;s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.</p>

He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honored with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman&#39;s family. Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister&#39;s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.</p>

Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect&#8212;</p>

If there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a&#160;clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other person.&quot;</span></p>

She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father&#39; and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the&#8213;&#8213; shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.</p>

The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning&#39;s impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.</p>

No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune<span class="gstxt_sup"></span>&#8212;or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent&#39;s mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behavior in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the. others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you then, my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA304.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.335.1.0.box.141.198.999.129.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA304"></a><a id="GBS.PA304.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA304.w.1.0.0"></a>

It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia&#39;s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honor were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. &quot;A gamester!&quot; she cried. &quot;This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.&quot;</p>

Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavors, he had yielded to his brother-in-law&#39;s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected,<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA305.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.336.1.0.box.101.192.998.77.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA305"></a><a id="GBS.PA305.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA305.w.1.0.0"></a>
