The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.</span></p>

His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.</p>

She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay below, with a book.

I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA38.w.1.5.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.69.1.5.box.137.955.997.132.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA38.w.1.5.0"></a>&quot;It is amazing to me,&quot; said Bingley, &quot;how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA38.w.1.6.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.69.1.6.box.138.1094.996.85.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA38.w.1.6.0"></a>&quot;All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA38.w.1.7.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.69.1.7.box.139.1187.997.225.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA38.w.1.7.0"></a>&quot;Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA38.w.1.8.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.69.1.8.box.140.1419.998.362.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA38.w.1.8.0"></a>&quot;Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,&quot; said Darcy, &quot;has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA38.w.1.9.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.69.1.9.box.184.1789.722.39.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA38.w.1.9.0"></a>&quot;Nor I, I am sure,&quot; said Miss Bingley.</p>

A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.&quot;</p>

<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA39.w.1.7.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.70.1.7.box.97.1302.999.309.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA39.w.1.7.0"></a>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.</p>

Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA40.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.71.1.2.box.160.468.995.85.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA40.w.1.2.0"></a>Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.</p>

Bingley urged Mr. Jones&#39;s being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother&#39;s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.</p>
