Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. &quot;It keeps him in good humor,&quot; said she, &quot;and I am more obliged to you than I can express.&quot; Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte&#39;s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of;&#8212;its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins&#39;s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas&#39;s scheme; and appearances were so favorable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA127.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.158.1.0.box.134.210.999.783.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA127"></a><a id="GBS.PA127.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA127.w.1.0.0"></a>
injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.</span></p>

The stupidity with which he was favored by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.</p>

Mr. Collins&#39;s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA128.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.159.1.0.box.128.197.1001.1611.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA128"></a><a id="GBS.PA128.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA128.w.1.0.0"></a>
of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James&#39;s. The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occcasion. The younger girls formed hopes of <span style="font-style:italic;">coming </span><span style="font-style:italic;">out </span>a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte&#39;s dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honorable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed</span><a id="GBS.PA128.w.1.0.0.1"></a><a id="GBS.PA129"></a><a id="GBS.PA129.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA129.w.1.0.0"></a><a id="ORIG-GBS.PA129.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.160.1.0.box.136.198.1002.320.q.60">
before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.</span></p>

Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.</p>

Charlotte did not stay much longer and Elizabeth was left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins&#39;s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte&#39;s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr.<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA132.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.163.1.0.box.124.179.999.215.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA132"></a><a id="GBS.PA132.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA132.w.1.0.0"></a>
