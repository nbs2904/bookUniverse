His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days&#39; time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.</p>

He is come&#8212;Mr. Bingley is come&#8212;He is indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.

After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, &quot;What is the matter, mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA354.w.1.4.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.385.1.4.box.141.981.1007.39.q.60"> &quot;Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.&quot;</p>

Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that <span style="font-style:italic;">she </span>would not give in to it.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA354.w.1.6.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.385.1.6.box.152.1350.999.132.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA354.w.1.5.0"></a>In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door, and called out, &quot;Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak<a id="GBS.PA354.w.2.0.0"></a> with you.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA354.w.1.7.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.385.1.7.box.152.1488.998.179.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA354.w.3.0.0"></a>Elizabeth was forced to go. &quot;We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,&quot; said her mother as soon as she was in the hall. &quot;Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA354.w.1.8.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.385.1.8.box.153.1673.997.132.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA354.w.3.1.0"></a>Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.</p>

Bingley was everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks, with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA355.w.1.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.386.1.1.box.125.576.1000.178.q.60">He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet&#39;s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA355.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.386.1.2.box.124.761.1070.317.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA355.w.1.2.0"></a>After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman&#39;s concurrence. <i> </i></p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA355.w.1.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.386.1.3.box.123.1086.1001.677.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA355.w.1.3.0"></a>Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet&#39;s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother&#39;s schemes.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA355.w.1.4.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.386.1.4.box.169.1778.954.41.q.70"><a id="GBS.PA355.w.1.4.0"></a>But on returning to the drawing-room when her letter<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA356.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.387.1.0.box.152.201.1006.597.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA356"></a><a id="GBS.PA356.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA356.w.1.0.0"></a>
was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. <span style="font-style:italic;">Their </span>situation was awkward enough; but <span style="font-style:italic;">hers, </span>she thought, was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.</span></p>

Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness, to Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA356.w.1.4.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.387.1.4.box.156.1362.997.306.q.50"><a id="GBS.PA356.w.1.4.0"></a>&quot;I must go instantly to my mother,&quot; she cried; &quot;I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself.

Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane&#39;s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.</p>

The satisfaction of Miss Bennet&#39;s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA358.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.389.1.0.box.151.199.995.85.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA358"></a><a id="GBS.PA358.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA358.w.1.0.0"></a>

I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.&quot;</p>

My dear Mr. Bennet,&quot; cried his wife, &quot;what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more.&quot; Then addressing her daughter, &quot;Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy, I am sure I shan&#39;t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!&quot;</p>

Jane was beyond competition her favorite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.</p>

In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.</p>
