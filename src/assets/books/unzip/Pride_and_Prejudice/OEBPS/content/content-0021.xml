The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy&#39;s pleasure in the Bingleys&#39; invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,</p>

Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA93.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.124.1.0.box.109.191.1002.223.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA93"></a><a id="GBS.PA93.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA93.w.1.0.0"></a>
injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humor which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.</span></p>

The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA93.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.124.1.2.box.110.1068.1001.491.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA93.w.1.2.0"></a>She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA93.w.1.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.124.1.3.box.153.1576.832.39.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA93.w.1.3.0"></a>&quot;I dare say you will find him very agreeable.&quot;</p>

<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA93.w.1.5.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.124.1.5.box.151.1760.959.41.q.70"><a id="GBS.PA93.w.1.5.0"></a>When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA94.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.125.1.0.box.159.186.1000.917.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA94"></a><a id="GBS.PA94.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA94.w.1.0.0"></a>
approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbors&#39; looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with&#8212;&quot;It is <span style="font-style:italic;">your </span>turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. <span style="font-style:italic;">I </span>talked about the dance, and <span style="font-style:italic;">you </span>ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.&quot;</span></p>

We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the &#233;clat of a proverb.&quot;</p>

She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist the temptation, added, &quot;When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA95.w.1.4.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.126.1.4.box.118.1026.999.364.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA95.w.1.4.0"></a>The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, &quot;Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his <span style="font-style:italic;">making </span>friends&#8212;whether he may be equally capable of <span style="font-style:italic;">retain</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ing </span>them, is less certain.&quot;</p>

<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA95.w.1.6.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.126.1.6.box.120.1536.999.269.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA95.w.1.6.0"></a>Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.</p>

Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:&#8212;but let me not interrupt you, sir.&#8212;You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.&quot;</p>

Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, &quot;Sir William&#39;s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.&quot;</p>

Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy&#39;s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy&#39;s using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favorite&#39;s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.&quot;</p>

You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.

he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow: and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words &quot;apology,&quot; &quot;Hunsford,&quot; and &quot;Lady Catherine de Bourgh.&quot; It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy&#39;s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.

When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley.&#8213;It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane&#39;s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.</span></p>

She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, &quot;That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.&quot;</span></p>

The rector of a parish has much to do.&#8212;In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.

that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.&quot; And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.&#8212;Many stared&#8212;many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.</span></p>

That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.</p>

She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail upon her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.

Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behavior to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of &quot;Lord, how tired I am!&quot; accompanied by a violent yawn.</p>
