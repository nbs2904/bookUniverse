Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.&quot;</p>

My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father&#39;s favorite in such a manner,&#8212;one, whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?&#8212;oh! no.&quot;</p>

If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.&quot;</p>

The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again,&#8212;called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet&#39;s civilities.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA89.w.1.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.120.1.1.box.138.944.1006.815.q.60">The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy&#39;s look and behavior. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA89.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.120.1.2.box.183.1775.954.38.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA89.w.1.2.0"></a>&quot;While I can have my mornings to myself,&quot; said she,<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA90.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.121.1.0.box.136.199.995.223.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA90"></a><a id="GBS.PA90.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA90.w.1.0.0"></a>
&quot;it is enough&#8212;I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I confess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.&quot;</span></p>

<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA90.w.1.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.121.1.3.box.129.1353.1000.453.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA90.w.1.3.0"></a>Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham&#39;s happ<a id="GBS.PA90.w.2.0.0"></a>iness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins&#39;s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that <span style="font-style:italic;">she </span>was selected from<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA91.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.122.1.0.box.146.205.1002.678.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA90.w.3.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA91"></a><a id="GBS.PA91.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA91.w.1.0.0"></a>
among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to <span style="font-style:italic;">her. </span>Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and, till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.</span></p>

No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after&#8212;the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.</p>
