As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.</p>

The <i>t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te </i>surprised them.

All field sports were over.<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA186.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.217.1.0.box.131.195.997.781.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA186"></a><a id="GBS.PA186.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA186.w.1.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA186.w.2.0.0"></a>
Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favorite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam&#39;s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.</span></p>

It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice&#8212;a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam&#39;s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA187.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.218.1.0.box.146.190.998.85.q.60">
