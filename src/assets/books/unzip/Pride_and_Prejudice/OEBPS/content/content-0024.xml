As for the gentleman himself, <span style="font-style:italic;">his </span>feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA120.w.2.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.151.2.1.box.142.897.1000.315.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA120.w.2.1.0"></a>The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet&#39;s ill humor or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he <a id="GBS.PA120.w.3.0.0"></a>still meant to stay.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA120.w.2.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.151.2.2.box.143.1221.999.361.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA120.w.4.0.0"></a>After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt&#39;s, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over.&#8212;To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence <span style="font-style:italic;">had </span>been self-imposed.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA120.w.2.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.151.2.3.box.144.1590.999.226.q.50"><a id="GBS.PA120.w.4.1.0"></a>&quot;I found,&quot; said he, &quot;as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;&#8212;that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.&quot;</p>

His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA121.w.1.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.152.1.1.box.148.608.1003.873.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA121.w.1.1.0"></a>Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady&#39;s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister&#39;s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, &quot;This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town&#8212;and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA121.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.152.1.2.box.147.1489.998.317.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA121.w.1.2.0"></a>She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: &quot;I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA122.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.153.1.0.box.114.200.998.549.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA122"></a><a id="GBS.PA122.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA122.w.1.0.0"></a>
we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.&quot; To these high-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley&#39;s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.</span></p>

Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd&#8212;but of that I despair.

I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister&#39;s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman&#39;s heart. With all these circumstances to favor an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?&#39;</p>

Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this:&#8212;We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been <span style="font-style:italic;">one </span>intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of <span style="font-style:italic;">your </span>merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.&quot;</p>
