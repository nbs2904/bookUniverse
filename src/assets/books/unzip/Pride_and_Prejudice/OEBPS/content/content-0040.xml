To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.</p>

But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me!&#8212;They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases.&quot;</p>

I must be in town next Saturday.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA218.w.1.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.249.1.3.box.138.660.997.225.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA218.w.1.3.0"></a>&quot;Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.

Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another <span style="font-style:italic;">month </span>complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you&#8212;and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.&quot;</p>

You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA219.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.250.1.0.box.158.205.998.502.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA219"></a><a id="GBS.PA219.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA219.w.1.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA219.w.2.0.0"></a>
Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to <span style="font-style:italic;">you </span>to let them go alone.&quot;</span></p>

Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of <span class="gstxt_sup"></span>unpleasant recollections.</p>

She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his addres<a id="GBS.PA219.w.3.0.0"></a>s, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.

In her own past behavior, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavor to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia but while they were supported by their mother&#39;s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia&#39;s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.</span></p>

His affection was proved to have been sincere, and and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecor<a id="GBS.PA220.w.3.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA220.w.4.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA220.w.5.0.0"></a>um of her own family!</p>
