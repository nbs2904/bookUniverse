The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.</p>

The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favorite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.</p>

When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.  They had all been very ill-used since she<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA145.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.176.1.0.box.158.190.999.124.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA145"></a><a id="GBS.PA145.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA145.w.1.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA145.w.2.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA145.w.3.0.0"></a>

But Lizzy! oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins&#39;s wife by this time, had not it&#39; been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbors who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.&quot;</p>

But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.&quot;</p>

It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour&#39;s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.

Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.

Is not general incivility the very essence of love?&quot;</p>

It had better have happened to <span style="font-style:italic;">you, </span>Lizzy;  you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But  do you think she would be prevailed on to go back  with us?

My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have <span style="font-style:italic;">heard </span>of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month&#39;s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.&quot;</span></p>

It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane&#39;s attractions.</p>

Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it&#8212;of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth&#39;s warm commendation of him, narrowly observed<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA148.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.179.1.0.box.144.186.997.269.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA148"></a><a id="GBS.PA148.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA148.w.1.0.0"></a>
them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.</span></p>

About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy&#39;s father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.</p>

Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy&#39;s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman&#39;s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.<span class="gstxt_sup"></span></p>
