It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel&#39;s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Should he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!&quot;</p>

It is really too great a violation of decency, honor, and interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?&quot;</p>

And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet Road.&quot;</p>

They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, if for no more exceptionable purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA288.w.1.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.319.1.3.box.171.749.1006.926.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA288.w.1.3.0"></a>&quot;But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no&#8212;this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane&#39;s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia&#8212;what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humor that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonorable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father&#39;s behavior, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that <span style="font-style:italic;">he </span>would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.&quot;</p>

But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects;  and for the last half-year&#8212;nay, for a twelve-month&#8212;she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater&#8212;what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.&quot;</p>

And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honor; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.&quot;</p>

in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty&#8212;<a id="GBS.PA290.w.1.1.0"></a>which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.&quot;</span></p>

Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the &#8213;&#8213;shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight&#39;s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighborhood [had] of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That <span style="font-style:italic;">she </span>could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as <span style="font-style:italic;">this </span>should ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts.&quot;</p>

he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished <span style="font-style:italic;">her </span>by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favorites.&quot;</span></p>

Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters&#39;, if they could be of use to us.&quot;</p>

His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady&#39;s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA300.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.331.1.0.box.169.174.1002.125.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA300"></a><a id="GBS.PA300.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA300.w.1.0.0"></a>
