Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA27.w.2.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.58.2.1.box.122.675.997.169.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA27.w.2.1.0"></a>She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.</p>

The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters&#39;, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighborhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA27.w.2.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.58.2.3.box.119.1603.1003.223.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA27.w.2.3.0"></a>Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers&#39; names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA28.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.59.1.0.box.130.202.996.270.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA28"></a><a id="GBS.PA28.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA28.w.1.0.0"></a>
Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley&#39;s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.</span></p>

I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.&quot;</p>

Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.</p>

<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA32.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.63.1.2.box.139.728.1000.686.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA32.w.2.2.0"></a>She was shown into the breakfast-parlor where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother&#39;s manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humor and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion&#39;s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.</p>

Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA33.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.64.1.0.box.108.218.1003.131.q.70"><a id="GBS.PA33"></a><a id="GBS.PA33.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA33.w.1.0.0"></a>
together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.</span></p>

The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavor to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent: the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.</p>

Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.</p>
