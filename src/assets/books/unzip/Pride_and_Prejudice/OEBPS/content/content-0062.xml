The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather <span style="font-style:italic;">knew </span>that she was happy, then <span style="font-style:italic;">felt </span>herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane, and even feared that with the others it was a <span style="font-style:italic;">dislike </span>which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.</p>

She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.</p>

She did not fear her father&#39;s opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means that <span style="font-style:italic;">she, </span>his favorite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA388.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.419.1.0.box.144.186.1000.225.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA388"></a><a id="GBS.PA388.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA388.w.1.0.0"></a>
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty, and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, &quot;Go to your father; he wants you in the library.&quot; She was gone directly.</span></p>

your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband&#8212;unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing <span style="font-style:italic;">you </span>unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.&quot;</span></p>

And so, Darcy did everything&#8212;made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow&#39;s debts, and got him his commission! So much the better! It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle&#39;s doing; I must and <span style="font-style:italic;">would </span>have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow: he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.&quot; He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins&#39;s letter; and after<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA390.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.421.1.0.box.145.196.1002.169.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA390"></a><a id="GBS.PA390.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA390.w.1.0.0"></a>

Everything was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded; and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.</p>

Its effect was most extraordinary; for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.</p>

Such a charming man!&#8212;so handsome! so tall!&#8212;Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy! A house in town!
