<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA370.w.3.0.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.401.3.0.box.152.744.1002.956.q.60"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The </span>discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome, nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and <span style="font-style:italic;">her </span>being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbors at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set <span style="font-style:italic;">that </span>down as almost certain and immediate which <span style="font-style:italic;">she </span>had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA370.w.3.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.401.3.1.box.155.1716.998.86.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA370.w.3.1.0"></a>In revolving Lady Catherine&#39;s expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA371.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.402.1.0.box.117.198.999.781.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA371"></a><a id="GBS.PA371.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA371.w.1.0.0"></a>
possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how <span style="font-style:italic;">he </span>might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than <span style="font-style:italic;">she </span>could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with <span style="font-style:italic;">one </span>whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.</span></p>

In that case, he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town, and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.</p>

Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her eldest sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.&#39;</span></p>

I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.&#39;&#8212;Mr. Collins, moreover, adds, &#39;I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia&#39;s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it.
