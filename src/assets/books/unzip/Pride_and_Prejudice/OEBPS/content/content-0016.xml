I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,&#8212;but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction&#160;of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o&#39;clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se&#39;nnight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far. from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.&#8212;I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,</span></p>

Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty,<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA66.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.97.1.0.box.143.192.1000.271.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA66"></a><a id="GBS.PA66.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA66.w.1.0.0"></a>
but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.</span></p>

The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet&#39;s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.
