Lady Catherine de Bourgh&#39;s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that &quot;he had never in his life witnessed such behavior in a person of rank&#8212;such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honor of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but <span style="font-style:italic;">he </span>had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighborhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA68.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.99.1.0.box.150.212.998.181.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA68"></a><a id="GBS.PA68.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA68.w.1.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA68.w.2.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA68.w.3.0.0"></a>

It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA68.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.99.1.2.box.152.586.1000.131.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA68.w.3.2.0"></a>&quot;The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship&#39;s residence.&quot;</p>

Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.&quot;</p>

of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are&#39; always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.&#8212;These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.&quot;</span></p>

His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.</p>

Mr. Collins readily<a id="GBS.PA69.w.2.0.0"></a> assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.

Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia&#39;s interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behavior as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.</p>
