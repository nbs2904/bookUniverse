The visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet&#39;s pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with <span style="font-style:italic;">them </span>was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother&#39;s admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he <span style="font-style:italic;">did </span>admire her; and to <span style="font-style:italic;">her </span>it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA19.w.3.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.50.3.1.box.136.1729.1000.85.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA19.w.3.1.0"></a>&quot;It may perhaps be pleasant,&quot; replied Charlotte, &quot;to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA20.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.51.1.0.box.122.195.1000.594.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA20"></a><a id="GBS.PA20.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA20.w.1.0.0"></a>
sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all <span style="font-style:italic;">begin </span>freely&#8212;a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a woman had better show <span style="font-style:italic;">more </span>affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister, undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.&quot;</span></p>

But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.&quot;</p>

As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA21.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.52.1.0.box.136.204.1002.259.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA21"></a><a id="GBS.PA21.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA21.w.1.0.0"></a>
regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.&quot;</span></p>

Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.&quot;</p>

But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.</span></p>
