When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA349.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.380.1.0.box.120.192.998.317.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA349"></a><a id="GBS.PA349.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA349.w.1.0.0"></a>
Bingley would take the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile; it was decided&#8212;he placed himself  by her.</span></p>

Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behavior. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humor. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them.</p>

She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother&#39;s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth&#39;s mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.</p>

opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutations attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.</span></p>

She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.</p>

I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn&#8212;and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases&#39; last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.

so, too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? &#39;Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.&#39; She did indeed.
