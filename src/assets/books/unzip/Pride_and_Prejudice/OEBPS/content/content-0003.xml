Yet her fame seems the least thing in our love of her, our joy in her subtle and beautiful and ever adequate art. It is the dignity and sweetness and brightness of her nature which take us most, and our affection grows in honor of her as we think over the modest facts of her gentle life, which can be told in twenty lines, but never can be told often enough in their full significance.</p>

Our other idols, literary idols, need veils in their temples where we like them to hide certain traits from us while we worship them, or at best receive from us a piety mixed with our pity; we cannot help knowing they were poor things, though divine. If our human frailties, our vices, our foibles, have a consecration in them it does not keep us from being ashamed, or at best, sorry for them. But this altogether admirable woman, good as she was great, we could offer praise without such reserve, when we joined last year in her apotheosis a century after her death. The defects of her qualities are as few as may be in our mortal conditioning, and they have the charm which she knew how to impart to the faults of her most endearing creations. But to talk of her so seems an offence against the restrained art which knew no excess, and it is like rather noisily boasting of the perfectly ascertained loveliness of characters like Anne Elliott, Emma Woodhouse, Fanny Price, Catherine Morland, and above all Elizabeth Bennet, which each in its sort derived from the character of Jane Austen; for whether she knew it or not she always drew from herself, and gave the creatures she loved the loveliness of her own soul.</p>

Her father was rector of the livings of Steventon and Dean, which adjoined each other in the County of Hampshire, and it was at Steventon that she came into the world, the fifth of a good many brothers and sisters. There she grew up through a very glad girlhood in a life rounded to its close by the limits of pleasant countrysides in Hants and Kent, and such now shrunken social capitals as Bath and Southampton and Winchester, with a few liberations of days and weeks to London for the pictures and fashions of that faded day. Life in that faded day was less provincial in provincial towns than now, and Jane Austen enjoyed it to the limit of her happy temperament. Against the background of their gayeties and the simpler pleasures of the country, and the joys of a family rich in the dreamings and doings of those many brothers and sisters, with herself first in their incentives, she painted her own portrait in the novels she wrote for twenty years and the letters she was always writing to the end. But in her own time, her star shone so dimly in the literary firmament, that only here and there a telescopic eye distinguished it from the nebulous host and such meteoric lustres as are always winking about the heavens of every time. The greatest and kindest of her contemporaries knew her excellence, and Scott&#39;s generous praise confessed her gift finer than his own; but criticism grew slowly to the sense of it. Now, indeed, her public is of a consciousness so intensively pervasive that it seems as if the literary world of her day were filled with her alone, as if she had been really sole in it; but that is a very mistaken idea. She was not alone even in her sort and this renders her work not less but more precious. If she was Shakespearean she was like Shakespeare in being first among her peers, or if peers is saying too much for them, then first among her kind, as he (to whom she has been too largely likened) was among his kind. Nobody begins of himself, and as Shakespeare, who was of his time and of such contemporaries as Jonson, Marlowe, Webster, Greene, Beaumont and Fletcher, began from many forgotten dramatists,<a id="ORIG-GBS.PR7.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.14.1.0.box.127.212.1002.121.q.60"><a id="GBS.PR7"></a><a id="GBS.PR7.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PR7.w.1.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PR7.w.2.0.0"></a>
Jane Austen was of such contemporaries as Maria Edgeworth, Frances Burney, Miss Ferrier, Richardson, Mrs. Opie, and began of such masters no longer remembered.</span></p>

Her style has  the rare distinction of absolute prose, which at times has the anxiety of literary decorum and is stiffened by the formality of the eighteenth century ideals, but is often of the simplicity of the best talk, and always of the naturalness which still freshly charms. It is never of poetic quality, it is the elect speech of life expressing itself without pretending to emotions not felt, but finding human nature sufficient for its highest effects. Her prose is never of rhythmical movement; she kept her dancing for the balls she loved; and her joy in human nature seldom went beyond it to the nature outside of it. Now and then, but seldom and very sparingly, she brings outdoors into her page; she mentions a shrubbery or a plantation, or a very dirty road; there is no parade of mountains or clouds, of forests or meadows; even when she has a party of her people go &quot;exploring,&quot; she makes no dramatic use of the scenery, and Box Hill does not share in the evolution of character; at the furthest, as with the woods of Pemberley in <span style="font-style:italic;">Pride </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Prejudice, </span>she permits herself a restrained topographical statement. There is convincing proof that she is no poet in the few lines which have survived from her very indifferent rhyming, and her favorite poet was George Crabbe,  who would have cast his fidelity to life in prose if he could, and confided it to verse because he must. Her admiration for his admirable tales in verse did not stop short of a deliciously playful pretence of passion for the poet himself, whom she avowed her purpose of marrying, without asking whether he had a wife or not already.</p>

We have only to call it satire in order to feel its difference from all other irony, and to find in it a sort of protesting pity, a sort of latent will<a id="ORIG-GBS.PR8.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.15.1.0.box.142.206.1004.1616.q.60"><a id="GBS.PR8"></a><a id="GBS.PR8.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PR8.w.1.0.0"></a>ingness that the reader shall come to the rescue against it. To be sure, almost every character in her fiction is more or less a fool, as every one is in life, and if there is not a tacit allowance from the author that she shares the universal folly with the reader, there is a sort of flattering concession that they form together something like the only exceptions to the rule. If he will consent to share the folly constantly bathed in the shimmer of that electrical irony, he cannot refuse her delight in the company of the fools who people her page and seldom fail of some appeal in their moments of sense or even nonsense. There are only a few stark-foolish fools, like first of all Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and Mrs. Bennet in <span style="font-style:italic;">Pride </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Prejudice. </span>Mrs. Norris in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mansfield </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Park, </span>John Thorp and General Tilney in <span style="font-style:italic;">North</span><span style="font-style:italic;">anger </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Abbey, </span>Sir Walter Elliott and Mrs. Tom Musgrove in <span style="font-style:italic;">Persuasion, </span>John Dashwood in <span style="font-style:italic;">Sense </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sensibility, </span>Mrs. Elton in <span style="font-style:italic;">Emma, </span>and a few besides, are beyond compassion because they are unkind and not because they are foolish. Even Mrs. Bennet has a redeeming pitiableness, even Mr. Collins entreats our tolerance because he is a sheer donkey and born so. Otherwise the fools are lost to mercy because they are not only foolish but cruel, and selfish and stupid and brutal and mean and vulgar. You cannot wish to save them from their folly, you can only desire them more and more abandoned to it. The worst of them are snobs, and snobs are fools for whom there is no redemption. These stand prominently out, and unjustly characterize the company of the pitiable and even lovable fools whom the reader ought to have it on his conscience to distinguish from them. He ought to remember the kindliness of Mr. Woodhouse and his thoughtfulness of others, the good-will of Miss Bates in <span style="font-style:italic;">Emma, </span>the blandness of Lady Bertran&#39;s selfishness in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mansfield </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Park, </span>the romantic wish to love as well as to be loved of Marianne Dashwood in <i>Sense </i><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sensibility, </span>the long endeavor of Lady Russell in <span style="font-style:italic;">Persuasion </span>to atone for an act of disastrous meddling, and the suffering of Anne Elliott for yielding to her influence, the girlish pure-heartedness of Catherine Morland in <span style="font-style:italic;">Northanger </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Abbey, </span>and others whom my memory fails of. They are wholly or partly foolish, but they are not voluntarily</span><a id="ORIG-GBS.PR9.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.16.1.0.box.99.179.1007.1034.q.60"><a id="GBS.PR9"></a><a id="GBS.PR9.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PR9.w.1.0.0"></a>
molestive or entirely ridiculous; they are of that succession of simpletons who abound in Jane Austen&#39;s fiction rather more than others&#39; fiction because she could not help seeing them in her world, where still they did not abound more than elsewhere. She had the fatal gift of observation, which is possibly the rarest gift of all, and where once a foible showed under her eye she could not help noting it to her reader; it did not matter that she loved and honored the character where she found it. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Pride </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Prejudice </span>the divine Elizabeth herself, whom she values beyond any of her creations, has moments of being quite a fool, and Darcy himself, high-minded and pure-minded, generous and magnanimous, as he was, and worthy of such a girl as Elizabeth was at her best, is in certain junctures a preposterous and all but impossible ass, a self-satisfied meddler and cruelly insensible to the suffering he unselfishly inflicts from respectable motives. Probably they were both quite what their author meant them to be, for she did nothing ignorantly, though for what they were she seems to have thought Elizabeth, much as she loved and admired her, more a fool than Darcy, whom she had too much sense herself to love or admire nearly as much. Perhaps she did not really love or admire him at all, though upon asking one of her most devoted readers I found that among even the wisest young people he was held in an impassioned awe.</span></p>

Her irony indeed broke into satire, into bitter sarcasm, toward the cruel and hopeless fools of her story; but for the others it was caressing to open fondness. They became her joke; a joke that they would have entered into themselves, if that could have been; and her tender amusement at their absurdity may well have come from the life of ingrowing family affection which she led among the brothers and sisters, and progressively nephews and nieces, in the home beloved of her beyond all the other world. It is known how<a id="ORIG-GBS.PR10.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.17.1.0.box.159.176.1010.195.q.60">

They were distinctly and in the best sense gentle, tending in the fondness of later times to gentility, but actually without that taint of conscious superiority which is the most perilous infection of gentle-folk. In this kingdom the second of the two sisters was unquestionably sovereign; her thought was always at work, always at play, and that of the others, especially of her older sister, was always at work and at play with her. Indefinitely early she began to write little stories so constantly among the rest that it might almost be said in cooperation with them; and she made little dramas, comedy tending to farce, which they acted together. At last, when her twenty years were ripe, she wrote a novel which her father thought so good that he offered it, with her proud but somewhat timorous consent, to the most respectable publisher he could think of; but, though he assured the publisher of this fact, Mr. Cadell, with the sometime fatuity of his trade, promptly declined it. Without losing the first post he returned the manuscript, and it was not until seven years later that <span style="font-style:italic;">Pride </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Prej</span><span style="font-style:italic;">udice </span>was given to the world by another house.

Elizabeth Bennet one may entirely love, while one may share her own misgivings as to her wisdom and taste at times, though one grows in regard for her good heart and in respect for her sound mind, not steadily but finally. One shares the author&#39;s conviction that she is the most adorable character in her fiction; she will not say in all fiction, but the reader need not share her scruple, and may well challenge other readers to name him any heroine equal to her. When I came to read <span style="font-style:italic;">Pride </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Prejudice </span>the tenth or fifteenth time at the close of 1917 for the purposes of this Introduction, I found it as fresh as when I read it first in 1889, after long shying off from it. I found it as fresh as at any earlier reading, but I had never realized before the open simplicity of the design, and the young artlessness of its art; so young that every now and then the artist lapsed to the artizan, and frankly operated a scheme which hesitated to operate itself. The quality of the different persons is disclosed from the beginning; the chief personages make no secret of their characteristics, and at their first encounter the history of their love might have been as fitly named <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrogance </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Impertinence </span>as <span style="font-style:italic;">Pride </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Prejudice. </span>But arrogance was not the keynote of Darcy&#39;s character, and impertinence was only the effect of semi-humorous resentment in Elizabeth; if they are both merely nasty at the first they quickly intimate their real natures, and in the retrospect one begins very soon to guess what they really are. Darcy indeed changes radically from his primary mistakenness, but Elizabeth without ceasing to be impertinent becomes more and more witty in the irony which delights from her to the happy close of their often tumultuous story. Her very fault, if gay pertness is a fault in a pretty girl who is also good, is part of her charm, and is immediately useful in helping the author to keep the whole story within the play of her characteristic irony. This sounds the depths as well as lights the surfaces of the drama, which it never allows to become utter tragedy, though it involves the effect of the passions which conduce to tragedy.</span></p>

readers whom I am supposed to be making acquainted with it. But I will not take this shabby chance; I will do nothing worse than deal with the points of the story as they have presented themselves in my own latest reading of it,  without trying to give the shape or sequence of a review to my essay. Every scene is full of character if not of incident, and the charm of Elizabeth is full of her sweetness and archness as well as her pertness. Every page of what is so distinctively a &quot;novel of manners&quot; testifies to the fidelity and veracity of the author&#39;s observation. The snobbishness of the local society whether in its ruder or finer vulgarity, has earlier recognition in Bingley&#39;s sister, who is instinctively jealous of Elizabeth from merely seeing her with Darcy, though their acquaintance begins in mutual repulsion. She sits beside Darcy while he writes, and comments on the symmetry and rapidity of his penmanship, for in that period of social formality he writes in the presence of the family with no more consciousness of being in it than a person takes up a book and begins to read, as often happens in the fiction if not the fact of the time. It happens in almost every novel, but I do not remember any other case of a gentleman lying down on a sofa in the drawing-room and going to sleep, outside of <span style="font-style:italic;">Pride </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Prejudice; </span>though I am sure the thing may have commonly happened, or Jane Austen would not have had Bingley&#39;s brother-in-law do it. People talked with a stilted formality and conversation moved with a high literary gait much beyond the imagination of our easy-going day. But even then it does not seem probable that two girls talked together like Elizabeth and her friend Charlotte Lucas, or that Charlotte should express her low views of matrimony so deliberately as she does. This is for the instruction of the reader, as the burlesque priggishness of Elizabeth&#39;s sister Mary is too openly for his diversion.</span></p>

People had then forgotten that passion, or impassioned conviction, expressed itself in poetic but almost never rhetorical terms, and authors with the rare gift of either seeing or hearing their fellow-beings, had not yet learned to report their looks or words as they really saw or heard them. Things went on from bad to worse throughout the long Georgian era, till late in the Victorian time, when fiction had escaped the instruction of the prepotent lexicographer (he never spoke as he wrote himself, however) and let its heroes and heroines utter their most intensive feelings as simply as they had felt. Jane Austen perhaps never unlearned the mistaken lesson which she had learned so painfully as well as with so much pains. But I think that in each successive novel her people employ the high horse less and less in their great emotions and keep the levels of life afoot, the levels which she loved beyond any other when she could consent to be herself or let them be themselves. I venture to think that the playful family spirit may have forgotten itself in the office of criticism, which again I fancy it must often have exercised upon the fiction so mostly created in the family midst with the family privity. But very possibly I am wrong, though I hate to own it, for I should like to believe that the faults of Jane Austen were always somebody else&#39;s faults.</span></p>

Elizabeth&#39;s aunt Mrs. Phillips which is scarcely even surpassed by that of her sister Lydia, though it attests itself supremely only in that moment when she flings up her window and shouts her hospitable good-will to the militia officers and their attendant young ladies in the street. Fool for fool it is hard to choose between Elizabeth&#39;s mother who appears in the earliest scene and her cousin Mr. Collins who comes on soon after the rise of the curtain and recurs again and again on the scene almost to the fall of the curtain. An author who was so faithful to nature could not in mere virtue of her youth be less loyal to convention than have a villain begin his machinations at the outset, but it must be owned that Wickham is very artistically handled, and that this admirably managed scoundrel is eclipsed only by the superior fascination of a fool so incomparable as Mr. Collins, whom nobody who ever knew him can have forgotten, any more than he forgot himself; if he has a blemish it is the ideal perfection of his folly, it is his so unfailingly acting in character. I cannot remember any passages of fiction more richly ridiculous than the rise and progress of his passion for Elizabeth springing instantly from his knowledge of her sister&#39;s probable engagement, and then instantly turning from her rejection of him to the comfort of her friend Charlotte Lucas&#39;s readily responsive affection. The whole thing is unsurpassed if not unparalleled comedy; there is no passage descriptive or expressive of him which fails the reader&#39;s just expectation in his spoken or written word. One abandons oneself to a supreme delight in his love-making, his self-appreciation as a clergyman, his veneration for his noble patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and his deference of all his clerical obligations to his duty to her; it is hard to determine whether he is more characteristic as host or guest or in what point he shines most; but if I must choose I think (though I am not sure) that I enjoy him most when, after Lydia&#39;s escapade, he writes to condole with her&#160;family and after dwelling upon all the calamitous aspects of the affair, and congratulating himself that Elizabeth&#39;s opportune rejection of him saved him any share in their sorrow and disgrace, he advises Lydia&#39;s father to &quot;console himself</span><a id="ORIG-GBS.PR15.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.22.1.0.box.95.227.1016.784.q.60"><a id="GBS.PR15"></a><a id="GBS.PR15.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PR15.w.1.0.0"></a>

There is something absolute in her selfish recklessness, her reckless pursuit of her own pleasure without the least regard not only to others but even to herself. She is no fool, at least not as the other fools are; after her one object in getting a husband at any cost is achieved she behaves with unprincipled devotion to the sole motive of her life: to get everything for herself without the least regret for the ways and means. She has a passion for Wickham, but simply because he contributes to her comfort and enables her to realize her quite childish ideal of worldly importance as a married woman. Otherwise she would not have cared to be married to him; she would have gone on living with him, molested by no regret for herself or thought of others.

But she is only one of those who fall a prey to his frank and winning powers of deceiving and betraying. He invites her to the danger of trusting her romantic prejudice against the man who has vexed her by seeming indifferent to her wit, to her steadfast self-respect, to her beauty and to her resentment of his high-principled but not very well reasoned pride which she takes for mere arrogance and insolence. She is so simple-hearted for all her irony, that she has no doubt of his good faith when he begins with her by telling her of his injured past and accusing the man whose whole family he has cruelly betrayed in every circumstance of their love and trust, and made their future kindness impossible. Yet Elizabeth is not in love with Wickham, as we duly learn, though she remains deceived by him until she tries to do herself the greatest possible harm with the man whom she has always, from the hour of her primal repulsion, been drawn to by those elemental forces which result in love and in spite of the centrifugal chances result in the happy marriages of fiction, if not quite so in<a id="ORIG-GBS.PR17.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.24.1.0.box.121.224.1019.1616.q.60"><a id="GBS.PR17"></a><a id="GBS.PR17.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PR17.w.1.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PR17.w.2.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PR17.w.3.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PR17.w.3.1.0"></a><a id="GBS.PR17.w.3.2.0"></a><a id="GBS.PR17.w.4.0.0"></a>variably of fact. It must be owned that the author does everything that can be done to make Darcy as acceptable to the reader as he becomes to Elizabeth, after she has succeeded in making all her friends believe she hates if not despises him. She accumulates every virtue upon him; there is not a noble or magnanimous action which she does not make him do, and one can well believe that the family circle of those Austens who assisted at his rehabilitation long before it was made public did not share the imaginable severity of her struggles, in rendering him lovable to the reader. It must have been a Titanic struggle with her to render him meek and modest and forgiving, an eater of humble pie in quantity unknown among heroes, and quite unexampled in <a id="GBS.PR17.w.5.0.0"></a>the lives of the English gentry. He not only comes to the rescue of the loathsome Lydia, but he yields to the rapacity of Wickham in letting him fix the conditions of marrying her, when she is quite willing to remain his mistress, and, so far as we are told, he never tries to beat him down. The author makes him the scapegoat of the situation; she&#160;accumulates on him not the sins but the virtues of his tribe; then she drives him not into the wilderness but into paradise. The miracle is in time for Elizabeth, but it is too late for the reader. So it seems to me, but again when I submitted the case to a younger reader, I was told that I was wrong; that Darcy is perfectly adorable and always was, and that if Elizabeth had not been perverted by Wickham and infected<a id="GBS.PR17.w.5.1.0"></a> with an all but fatal prejudice she would have&#160;known it from the start. Perhaps the elderly reader is not given time to recover from the effect of Darcy&#39;s arrogant offer of his love to Elizabeth, his acknowledgment of his contempt for her family, his vaunting confession that he broke off the affair between her sister and Bingley, and did whatever else he could do to outrage her self-respect and wound her feelings, before he begins to show himself in a better light; to bring himself by a <span style="font-style:italic;">tour </span><span style="font-style:italic;">de </span><span style="font-style:italic;">force </span>to buy off Wickham from Lydia&#39;s willing dishonor; to feel the goodness and essential refinement of Elizabeth&#39;s uncle, who, although he is in trade, is willing to pay Lydia&#39;s ransom from his narrow means and at the cost of his own family; to receive him and his</span><a id="GBS.PR17.w.5.1.0.1"></a><a id="GBS.PR17.w.5.2.0"></a><a id="ORIG-GBS.PR18.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.25.1.0.box.110.216.1003.950.q.60"><a id="GBS.PR18"></a><a id="GBS.PR18.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PR18.w.1.0.0"></a>
wife when they happen with Elizabeth at his country seat; to bring his sister to call upon her, and try to make them all his guests; to show her every proof of his regret short of words for his past conduct; to throw off his disguise of pride, and reveal himself in his true character of a gentleman by nature as well as birth, kind, considerate, and even meek at every point where you would have him so. All this is supposed to happen, but life is short, especially for elderly readers, and the art of the author is long in bringing her ends about; she brings them about by very rough magic at times. The surrender of Darcy is effected by main force when he first offers himself, and the struggle is not so hard to have him renew his suit. By that time Elizabeth had worked round to him &quot;when he had become unattainable&quot; and they had reached their common conclusion that they had each thrown a pearl away. Still the affair is obviously operated, and if it had not been for Lydia&#39;s elopement and the disgrace which Darcy was obliged to share with Elizabeth, I could not accept the conclusion as inevitable. It is to be allowed that they talk reasonably about the event which shocks everybody but Lydia and Wickham, and it is to be realized that no love affair was ever treated in its minor aspects with so much open good sense.</span></p>

It is a scene which in her ladyship&#39;s defeat gives the utmost comfort to the younger reader and compensates the suffering sage for all his doubts. If it is not true to fact it is true to life, and it is triumphantly true to Elizabeth and her inborn ability upon occasion to rout Lady Catherine and every like of her. Better yet it clothes her with final authority to make peace between Darcy and his aunt and to urge his forgiveness when marriage has put her in possession of the field.

Without their engagement and imminent marriage, how could it be that &quot;Elizabeth&#39;s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. &#39;How could you begin?&#39; said she. &#39;I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning, but what could set you off in the first place? ... My beauty you had early withstood; and as for my manners, my behavior to you was always at least bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.

In spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just. ... There, I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.

But perhaps it has recurred often and often, and it is only the superlative charm of it in this passage that wins us from other knowledge of it. It is the very heart of Elizabeth Bennet which opens itself in the lively episode, that is to say the heart of Jane Austen, who is almost one with her, and was always writing herself into her, in her irony, her playfulness, her final dignity of heart and mind. The denouement is so unhurried that the reader has as much time as he wants for his pleasure in her character after her rejection of Mr. Collins to Charlotte Lucas&#39;s precipitate acceptance of him, but he does not at once reconcile himself to Elizabeth&#39;s visiting her friend in fulfillment of a rash promise and an obligation of the author&#39;s to bring about her second meeting with Darcy, with his offer<a id="ORIG-GBS.PR20.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.27.1.0.box.126.188.1003.1490.q.60">
to her and her enlightenment with regard to Wickham, and all the events that roughly contribute to smooth the course of their true love. Her language is never more unnaturally rhetorical than when she rejects Darcy, or her behavior more truly natural than when she breaks down and cries as soon as he leaves her. Without this rather forced series of events we should never have had Lady Catherine de Bourgh, so increasingly precious to the end, with her ideal of herself as a great lady empowered to meddle with everybody&#39;s affairs and her goodness to her tenants whom, when she found them hungry and unhappy, she &quot;scolded into harmony and plenty.&quot; Elizabeth&#39;s self-analysis is always good, and it is a just tribute to her character as she reveals it when Darcy tells her of Wickham&#39;s attempted elopement with his innocent young sister when he wishes to make her understand perfectly how mistaken she has been. It is the greatest sacrifice of himself that he can offer, and is far beyond his gentlemanly instinct in bringing the young girl to call upon Elizabeth after their accidental meeting at Pemberley. That is something he owes to himself as a gentleman, but the other is something he owes to her. I can scarcely think of any point where she fails in her claim on our affection, our respect, though she is often mistaken and sometimes absurd. It is no wonder that the author loves her, and cannot think of her but as the finest creature in that world of imagination where she mostly had her own being. There are little incidents which are related to her through her kindly charm, as when the children of her Uncle Gardiner wait for her on the stair when she first comes to his house, and her gratitude to him and her aunt for not being as vulgar as Darcy thinks all her kindred is pathetic. Not everything is so simply contrived, but the things that must be inevitably gain worth at her hands from their necessity, like her telling Darcy of Lydia&#39;s elopement, and again her owning her knowledge of his goodness in paying Wickham the price of saving her family from the shame that Lydia would never feel.</span></p>

spare her. That most lovable creature always reached a merciful conclusion in any question through her angelic reasonableness; the greatest difficulty she seems ever to have had, after being persuaded to think ill of Darcy by Elizabeth, was learning from her to think well enough of him to believe in her love for him. To be sure, she had undergone much in being taught to believe Wickham a villain; and the changes were almost too great for her constant nature. The affection of these sisters is one of the sweetest things in all fiction, and the art, the truth, of the author in always guarding the soul of Jane from insipidity is miraculous. She is allowed to think and say all the good of everybody without lapsing into fatuous optimism or doubting the keener wisdom of Elizabeth, who loves her even beyond their father. He is always Elizabeth&#39;s great friend, her good comrade, whose sarcasm saves her from the silliness of her mother and flatters her with a not too great sense of her equality with himself, but whose foibles she recognizes in the terrible hour when she has to confess the truth of Darcy&#39;s cruel arraignment of her family for its vulgarity. It is pathetic to have him own that he has not been all a father should to his varied girls, that he owed something more than he has done even for Lydia, and has not at least tried to keep her from being a worse fool than her mother. We never have enough of him; he is not staled by our foreknowledge of how he will take anything about to happen, but is as freshly delightful at the last when he calls Elizabeth to him to know what right Darcy has to ask for her hand, and to confess that he has already granted it, Darcy being the sort of man he would not think of denying anything he asks. Lydia being married and Jane engaged, and Elizabeth given away, it is with her own joy in him that we hear him charge her to send him any other young men who may be wanting to marry Kitty or Mary, for now he is quite at leisure to see them. We really cannot get enough of his saying that of&#160;all his sons-in-law Wickham is his favorite or not want him to keep on saying it always.</span></p>

remember the author otherwise indulging herself in. Mary must remain what she is, but the hope of the petulant Kitty&#39;s becoming less silly under the influence of Jane and Elizabeth does not seem unreasonable. There is no such hope for her mother, but we would not have Mrs. Bennet less perfect a fool than she is to the last. What is most wonderful in her is the perennial youthfulness of her folly. She is never any older than the youngest of her daughters, but it is to be owned for her rapture in Lydia&#39;s marriage that it is not greater than in that of Jane and of Elizabeth, though in her mounting satisfaction with their successively mounting wealth and station she tries not to distinguish among them. I am not quite sure that I like her being somewhat quelled by Darcy; but it is inevitable, and it is to be considered that she remains equal to her affectionate and familiar delight in Bingley and Jane; and I think it to Bingley&#39;s credit that he does not and could not do anything to snub her overwhelming fondness. This, if there were no other proof of his goodness, would be quite enough. Jane is equal to the even greater task of loving his unkind sisters, though I doubt if Elizabeth ever admitted Miss Bingley&#39;s overtures to her friendship after she was married to Darcy. I think there must always have been some flashes of her irony to light up the forgiveness of the friend who meant him for herself, and tried for him through every discouragement.</span></p>

There is trouble enough in real life, but it is mostly annulled by the use of common sense and patience and kindness even by people who have tried to do themselves mischief. Perhaps something like the oversoul helps the good ending and leaves us quite comfortable if not perfectly contented. We might have wished Wickham punished to the limit of his deserts, but we can manage with the quiet scorn Elizabeth makes him feel when she spares him, and it is her sufficient condemnation of Lydia to have her say that &quot;Lydia is Lydia still.&quot;</p>

I do not believe that Jane Austen would resent the familiarity if she were still alive, as indeed she is, apparently more and more as the years grow into the centuries. I wish we were all worthier her tolerance, but it is my hopeful remembrance of her kindness to others that it is never apportioned among the deserving alone but is bestowed on many as little deserving as ourselves, both in and out of her books.</p>
