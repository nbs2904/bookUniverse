She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favorite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talk<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA188.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.219.1.0.box.140.180.1001.639.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA188"></a><a id="GBS.PA188.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA188.w.1.0.0"></a>ing or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third <span style="font-style:italic;">rencontre </span>that he was asking some odd unconnected questions&#8212;about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins&#39;s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying <span style="font-style:italic;">there </span>too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.</span></p>

There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world <span style="font-style:italic;">two </span>men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, <span style="font-style:italic;">he </span>was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for awhile every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.</p>

Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach.&quot; When she thought of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections <span style="font-style:italic;">there </span>had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend&#39;s connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.</p>

Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine&#39;s being rather displeased by her staying at home.</p>
