Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: &quot;May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honor of a<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA109.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.140.1.0.box.116.203.1000.40.q.70"><a id="GBS.PA109"></a><a id="GBS.PA109.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA109.w.1.0.0"></a>

I am sure Lizzy will be very happy&#8212;I am sure she can have no objection.

You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there <span style="font-style:italic;">not </span>been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother&#39;s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA110.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.141.1.0.box.148.201.1000.177.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA110"></a><a id="GBS.PA110.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA110.w.1.0.0"></a>

Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford&#8212;between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh&#39;s footstool, that she said, &#39;Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry.&#8212;Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for <span style="font-style:italic;">my </span>sake; and for your <span style="font-style:italic;">own, </span>let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.&#39; Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA111.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.142.1.0.box.122.199.1011.1103.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA111"></a><a id="GBS.PA111.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA111.w.1.0.0"></a>
excite. Thus much for my general intention in favor of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighborhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honored father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place&#8212;which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied&#160;with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother&#39;s decease, is all that you may&#160;ever he entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.&quot;</span></p>

I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make <span style="font-style:italic;">me </span>happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make <span style="font-style:italic;">you </span>so.

You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.&quot; And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her:</p>

on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favorable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.&quot;</span></p>

My reasons for believing it are briefly these:&#8212;It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the&#160;establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favor; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.&quot;</p>
