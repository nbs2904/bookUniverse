To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. Th<a id="GBS.PA77.w.1.2.0"></a>e officers of the &#8213;&#8213;shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as <span style="font-style:italic;">they </span>were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.</p>

the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.</span></p>

At first there seemed danger of Lydia&#39;s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told&#8212;the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA79.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.110.1.0.box.113.198.1002.179.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA79"></a><a id="GBS.PA79.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA79.w.1.0.0"></a>
