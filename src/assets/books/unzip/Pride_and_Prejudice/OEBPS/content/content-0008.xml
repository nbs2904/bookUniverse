Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honor of knighthood by an address to the king, during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James&#39;s had made him courteous.</p>

They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth&#39;s intimate friend.</p>

Mr. Robinson&#39;s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and <span style="font-style:italic;">which </span>he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question&#8212;&#39;Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.&#39;&quot;</p>

By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or the other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.</p>
