The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine&#39;s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.</p>

Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.</p>

Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest&#8212;there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction or rank preserved.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA166.w.1.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.197.1.3.box.156.927.1001.401.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA166.w.1.3.0"></a>While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James&#39;s.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA166.w.1.4.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.197.1.4.box.158.1343.999.363.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA166.w.1.4.0"></a>As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA166.w.1.5.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.197.1.5.box.159.1712.1047.85.q.60">When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria&#39;s alarm was every moment increas<a id="GBS.PA167"></a><a id="GBS.PA167.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA167.w.1.0.0"></a>ing, and even Sir William<a id="GBS.PA167.w.1.0.0.1"></a><a id="GBS.PA167.w.1.1.0"></a><a id="ORIG-GBS.PA167.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.198.1.0.box.126.201.999.268.q.60">
did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth&#39;s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.</span></p>

Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA167.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.198.1.2.box.122.939.1010.823.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA167.w.1.2.0"></a>In spite of having been at St. James&#39;s, Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.&#8212;<a id="GBS.PA167.w.1.3.0"></a>Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth&#39;s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.</p>

There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.</span></p>

He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh&#8212;the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA169.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.200.1.0.box.120.196.1001.214.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA169"></a><a id="GBS.PA169.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA169.w.1.0.0"></a>

She inquired into Charlotte&#39;s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady&#39;s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother&#39;s maiden name?&#8212;Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.&#8212;Lady Catherine then observed,</p>

prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe&#39;s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. &#39;Lady Catherine,&#39; said she, &#39;you have given me a treasure.&#39; Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?&quot;</span></p>

Perhaps <span style="font-style:italic;">she </span>is full young to be much in company. But really, ma&#39;am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on <span style="font-style:italic;">such </span>a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.&quot;</p>

Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at casino, the two girls had the honor of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh&#39;s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking&#8212;stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.</p>

The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA173.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.204.1.0.box.144.204.1000.398.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA173"></a><a id="GBS.PA173.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA173.w.1.0.0"></a>
Collins&#39;s side, and as many bows on Sir William&#39;s, they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte&#39;s sake, she made more favorable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship&#39;s praise into his own hands.</span></p>
