<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA272.w.2.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.303.2.1.box.132.599.1002.307.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA272.w.2.1.0"></a>On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows, opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA272.w.2.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.303.2.2.box.134.923.1001.408.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA272.w.2.2.0"></a>In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana&#39;s reception of them was very civil, but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA272.w.2.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.303.2.3.box.134.1339.1000.454.q.50"><a id="GBS.PA272.w.2.3.0"></a>By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose [endeavor] to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it;<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA273.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.304.1.0.box.137.197.999.84.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA273"></a><a id="GBS.PA273.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA273.w.1.0.0"></a>

This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley&#39;s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA273.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.304.1.2.box.140.1075.999.446.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA273.w.1.2.0"></a>The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party&#8212;for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA273.w.1.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.304.1.3.box.141.1537.998.269.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA273.w.1.3.0"></a>While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.</p>

No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;&#8212;a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behavior when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley&#39;s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother&#39;s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility&#8212;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA274.w.1.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.305.1.1.box.141.1239.1000.134.q.60">&quot;Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the &#8213;&#8213;shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to <span style="font-style:italic;">your </span>family.&quot;</p>

While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with con<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA275.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.306.1.0.box.142.174.1000.908.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA275"></a><a id="GBS.PA275.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA275.w.1.0.0"></a>fusion and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy&#39;s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy&#39;s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley&#39;s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should effect his endeavor to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.</span></p>

Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully. Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth&#39;s person, behavior, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother&#39;s recommendation was enough to insure her<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA276.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.307.1.0.box.122.176.1004.269.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA276"></a><a id="GBS.PA276.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA276.w.1.0.0"></a>
favor: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.</span></p>

Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character&#8212;there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.&quot;</p>
