In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Long<span class="gstxt_sup"></span><a id="ORIG-GBS.PA41.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.72.1.0.box.107.188.999.260.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA41"></a><a id="GBS.PA41.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA41.w.1.0.0"></a>bourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.

She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter&#39;s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little with Jane, on Miss Bingley&#39;s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlor. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.</p>

Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.</p>

He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA43.w.1.6.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.74.1.6.box.115.1255.1001.177.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA43.w.2.6.0"></a>&quot;Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighborhood, I believe there are few neighborhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.&quot;</p>

His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother&#39;s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been in Longbourn since <span style="font-style:italic;">her </span>coming away.</p>

an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley&#8212;is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy!&#8212;He has always something to say to everybody.&#8212;<span style="font-style:italic;">That </span>is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.&quot;</span></p>

But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome!

Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane&#39;s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane&#8212;one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner&#39;s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.&quot;</p>

She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.</p>

She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle&#39;s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother&#39;s ear&#8212;</p>
