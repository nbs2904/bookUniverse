<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA160.w.3.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.191.3.1.box.172.1444.998.263.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA160.w.4.1.0"></a>When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.</p>

The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA161.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.192.1.0.box.134.194.1015.871.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA161"></a><a id="GBS.PA161.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA161.w.1.0.0"></a>
pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin&#39;s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlor he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife&#39;s offers of refreshment.</span></p>

But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sign of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA162.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.193.1.0.box.153.191.999.919.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA162"></a><a id="GBS.PA162.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA162.w.1.0.0"></a>
journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.</span></p>

It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte&#39;s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.</p>

She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honored with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honors us during your stay here. Her behavior to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship&#39;s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I <span style="font-style:italic;">should </span>say, one of her ladyship&#39;s carriages, for she has several.&quot;</p>

She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.</p>

seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out&#8212;</span></p>
