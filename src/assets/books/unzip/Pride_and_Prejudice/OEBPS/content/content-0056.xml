Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.</p>

Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure <span style="font-style: italic;">I </span>never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what <span style="font-style:italic;">may </span>happen? But that is nothing to us.

her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley&#39;s friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming&#8212;at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behavior in Derbyshire.</span></p>

She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual, and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her mother&#39;s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.</p>

his attention. He found her as handsome as she had been last year,&#8212;as good-natured and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.
