Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humor, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA54.w.3.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.85.3.1.box.144.1024.1001.685.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA54.w.3.1.0"></a>But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley&#39;s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was &quot;very glad&quot;; but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley&#39;s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA54.w.3.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.85.3.2.box.144.1716.999.77.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA54.w.3.2.0"></a>When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card table&#8212;but in vain. She had obtained<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA55.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.86.1.0.box.116.210.1007.447.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA55"></a><a id="GBS.PA55.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA55.w.1.0.0"></a>
private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother&#39;s conversation with Miss Bennet.</span></p>

She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, &quot;How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!&#8212;When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.&quot;</p>

She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said&#8212;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA55.w.1.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.86.1.3.box.123.1552.1002.261.q.50"><a id="GBS.PA55.w.1.3.0"></a>&quot;By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?&#8212;I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.&quot;</p>

It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA56.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.87.1.2.box.138.717.1002.76.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA56.w.1.2.0"></a>&quot;Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.&quot;</p>

Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;&#8212;but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said&#8212;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA56.w.1.4.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.87.1.4.box.136.1087.1002.169.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA56.w.1.4.0"></a>&quot;Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.&#8212;I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.&quot;</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA56.w.1.5.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.87.1.5.box.136.1271.1003.538.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA56.w.1.5.0"></a>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. &quot;What could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning&quot;&#8212;and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?</p>
