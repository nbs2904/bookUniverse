<p>There are five chief lines of <span class="locked">descent—</span></p>
<div class="blockquot hang">
<p>From <span class="smcap">Caius Julius Cæsar</span> through his great-nephew and adopted son Octavianus, known after <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 27 as Augustus.</p>
<p>From <span class="smcap">Caius Julius Cæsar</span> through his great-niece Octavia, sister to Augustus.</p>
<p>From <span class="smcap">Marcus Antonius</span> through his children by his second wife, Octavia.</p>
<p>From <span class="smcap">Tiberius Claudius Nero</span> through his two sons by Livia, the second wife of Augustus.</p>
<p>From <span class="smcap">Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa</span> through his children by Julia I, the daughter of Augustus.</p>
</div>
<p class="p2 center larger">CAIUS JULIUS CÆSAR OCTAVIANUS AUGUSTUS</p>
<p class="center">married</p>
<div class="blockquot hang">
<p class="hang1">I.  A daughter of Marcus Antonius and Fulvia, whom he almost immediately repudiated.</p>
<p class="hang2">II.  Scribonia, related by marriage to the family of Pompeius, issue one daughter, Julia I.</p>
<p>III.  Livia, no issue; but by her previous husband, Tiberius Claudius Nero, Livia had two sons, Tiberius and Drusus I.</p>
</div>
<p class="p2 center larger">OCTAVIA</p>
<p class="center">married</p>
<div class="blockquot hang">
<p>I.  <span class="smcap">Marcus Marcellus</span> I, issue Marcus Marcellus II, and two daughters, Marcella I, Marcella II.</p>
<div class="blockquot hang">
<p>Marcus Marcellus II married Julia I, and died without issue, “tu Marcellus eris.”</p>
<p>Marcella I married first Agrippa, no issue, and then<a id="Page_433" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="433"></a> Julius Antonius, son of Marcus Antonius, by his first wife, Fulvia.</p>
<p>Marcella II, her marriage is not mentioned.</p>
</div>
<p>II.  <span class="smcap">Marcus Antonius</span>, issue two daughters, Antonia I, Antonia II.</p>
<div class="blockquot hang">
<p>Antonia I married L. Domitius Abenobarbus, and thus became one of the grandmothers of the Emperor Nero.</p>
<p>Antonia II married Drusus I, issue Germanicus, Claudius, who succeeded Caligula as Emperor, Livilla. Germanicus married Agrippina I, Claudius eventually married Agrippina II. Livilla married Drusus II, the son of Tiberius.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="p2 center larger">MARCUS ANTONIUS</p>
<p>His blood ran in the family through his two daughters, Antonia I and Antonia II; his sons by his first wife, Fulvia, did not marry into the Julian or Claudian families; one of them was put to death as a paramour of Julia I.</p>
<p class="p2 center larger">TIBERIUS CLAUDIUS NERO</p>
<p class="center">married Livia, issue two sons, Tiberius the Emperor and Drusus I.</p>
<div class="blockquot hang">
<p>Tiberius married first Vipsania, daughter of Agrippa by his first wife, Pomponia, who was daughter of Pomponius Atticus, the banker, and friend of Cicero, issue one son, Drusus II, married Livilla, issue one son, Tiberius, murdered by Caligula.</p>
<div class="blockquot hang in1">
<p>Secondly, Julia I, daughter of Augustus, no issue.</p>
</div>
<p>Drusus I married Antonia II, issue Germanicus, Claudius, Livilla. Germanicus married Agrippina I, daughter of Julia I, granddaughter of Augustus and M. Vipsanius Agrippa; issue Nero I, Drusus III, Caius (Caligula) Agrippina II, Drusilla, Julia Livilla who married M. Vinicius, the friend of Paterculus.</p>
<p>These are the six children whose claims to represent the true<a id="Page_434" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="434"></a> Julian stock were so vehemently asserted by their mother, Agrippina I. They derived their Julian blood from Octavia, through their grandmother Antonia II, on the father’s side, and from Augustus through their grandmother, Julia I, on the mother’s side.</p>
</div>
<p class="p2 center larger">MARCUS VIPSANIUS AGRIPPA</p>
<p class="center">married</p>
<div class="blockquot hang">
<p class="hang1">I.  Pomponia, issue Vipsania the first wife of Tiberius, she was thus the mother of Drusus II; after her divorce from Tiberius she married Caius Asinius Gallus.</p>
<p class="hang2">II.  Marcella I, sister to “tu Marcellus eris,” daughter of Octavia by her first husband, no issue; after her divorce she married Julius Antonius.</p>
<p>III.  Julia I, daughter of Augustus, and his only child; issue Caius Cæsar, Lucius Cæsar, Julia II, Agrippina I, Agrippa Postumus; on the death of Agrippa, Julia I married Tiberius, she was afterwards divorced and banished on account of misconduct, which appears to have been political, at least as much as it was adulterous.</p>
<div class="blockquot hang in1">
<p>Caius Cæsar died without issue.</p>
<p>Lucius Cæsar died without issue.<br/>
(After being regarded as the probable heirs of Augustus.)</p>
<p>Julia II married an Æmilius Paullus, but was banished like her mother for similar reasons.</p>
<p>Agrippina I married Germanicus.</p>
<p>Agrippa Postumus, the intractable, was banished by Augustus, and put out of the way at the accession of Tiberius; by whose orders is not definitely certain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Through Agrippina the obscure Agrippa was the grandfather of one Emperor, Caligula, and the great grandfather of another, Nero.</p>
